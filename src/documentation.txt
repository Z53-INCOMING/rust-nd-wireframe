rotations.txt:
    every line is a plane of rotation.
    first two numbers are the axes, last number is 0 for a camera space rotation and 1 for an object space rotation.

motion.txt:
    first line is the position of the object initially. if it's too short, don't worry, the axes after just won't be set, it won't crash.
    second line is the motion over the course of the whole animation, and again, it'll only apply to the first n axes.
    
    motion and starting position cannot be applied to the Z (2) axis.

setup.txt:
    first line is a path to the polytope you wish to load, local to this folder starting with "./".
    second line is the resolution of the animation.
    third line is the number of frames in the animation.

axes:
    0 - right
    1 - up
    2 - forward
    3 - ana, orange
    4 - V+, green
    5+ - some high dimensional axis, they all get treated the same, they just fade out radially
    
    "orange" and "green" here refer to 90 degree apart hues on the hue circle. the WV (3, 4) plane is rendered as a hue circle with different angles.

controls:
    LMB/MMB + move mouse - pan XZ YZ
    CTRL + pan - pan XW YW
    Z + pan - pan XV YV
    X + pan - pan XU YU
    C + pan - pan XT YT
    V + pan - pan XS YS
    B + pan - pan XR YR
    N + pan - pan XQ YQ
    
    scroll wheel - make image larger or smaller
    CTRL + scroll wheel - change perspective
    
    Q/A - move fade start forward and backward. everything behind this point doesn't lose any brightness, everything after it does until fade end
    W/S - move fade end forward and backward. everything after this point is invisible, everything behind it gets brighter and brighter until fade start
    E/D - expands/contracts the extra dimensional fade, aka it controls how far you see into what's perpendicular to XYZ
    R/F - controls the number of subdivisions of the edges
    
    Enter - starts the animation, and starts writing frames to ./images. be warned- you can still do all the usual inputs while it's rendering, if you accidentally pan or something it will be visible in the animation.
